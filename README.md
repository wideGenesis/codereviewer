# CodeReviewer

CodeReviewer is an AI-driven tool designed to help developers automate the process of code reviews in Python projects. By leveraging machine learning models and natural language processing, this tool can analyze code changes in pull requests (PRs) and provide intelligent feedback and suggestions for improvements.

## Features
- **Automated Code Review**: Analyze changes in Python code, provide comments, and suggest improvements on pull requests.
- **Integration with Git**: Fetches code changes directly from Git repositories, enabling easy integration with version control workflows.
- **AI-powered Analysis**: Uses state-of-the-art machine learning models to identify code smells, suboptimal patterns, and other common issues in Python code.

## Installation

To install CodeReviewer, clone the repository and set up the necessary environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wideGenesis/codereviewer.git
cd codereviewer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed.

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Git Repository**: Make sure your Python project is version-controlled with Git.
2. **Run the CodeReviewer**: You can run the review process by specifying the path to your repository and the branch you want to analyze.
3. **Generate Report**: The tool will generate a detailed report with suggestions and comments based on the AI's analysis.
