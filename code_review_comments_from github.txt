### Review for app.py:

Your code changes appear to enhance the structure and readability of the code by reducing duplication and centralizing configuration. Here are some suggestions for further improvements:

1. **Import Order and Cleanliness**:
    - Organize your import statements according to the PEP 8 guidelines: standard libraries first, followed by third-party libraries, then local application imports. This improves readability.
    - Consider removing any unused imports to keep the code clean.

2. **Environment Variables Handling**:
    - It would be beneficial to handle cases where the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable might not be set, potentially raising an error or logging a warning. Example:
        ```python
        api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        if api_key is None:
            logger.error("OPENAI_API_KEY is not set.")
            return
        completion_client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)
        ```

3. **Magic Strings**:
    - You have "hardcoded" constants like `"C:\\Users\\Genesis\\PycharmProjects\\codereviewer"` and `model_name`. Consider using an external configuration file or environment variables for these so that your code is more flexible and adaptable to different environments.

4. **Docstrings**:
    - Your functions have docstrings that describe their purpose, which is good practice. 
    - Consider using a more specific format by specifying the parameters and return types. For example:
        ```python
        def run_local_code_reviewer() -> None:
            """Executes a local code review for the specified repository, branch, and output file.

            Returns:
                None
            """
        ```

5. **Code Maintainability**:
    - Consider extracting constants into a separate configuration class or module, especially if you foresee using other configurations in the future.

6. **Function Naming**:
    - Ensure that the function names clearly describe their actions. For example, `run_local_code_reviewer` might be clearer as `execute_local_code_review` to imply action.

7. **Error Handling**:
    - Implement try-except blocks around calls that can fail (such as client initializations and external service calls) to handle exceptions more gracefully.

8. **Main Guard**:
    - If you add more functionality, consider organizing the code that follows the `if __name__ == '__main__':` check into functions or classes to improve modularity.

Here's a revised version incorporating some of these suggestions:

```python
import logging
import os
from common.az_logger.global_logger import CustomLogger
from git_hub.gh_client import git_hub_code_reviewer
from git_local.local_client import local_code_reviewer
from openai import OpenAI
from open_ai.prompt.llm_prompt import SYSTEM, USER

# Initialize the logger
AZURE_LOGGER_NAMES = ['azure.core.pipeline.policies.http_logging_policy', 'azure.storage']
for logger_name in AZURE_LOGGER_NAMES:
    logging.getLogger(logger_name).setLevel(logging.WARNING)

# Constants
REPO_PATH = "C:\\Users\\Genesis\\PycharmProjects\\codereviewer"  # Consider externalizing
BRANCH_NAME = "rel_01"  # Consider externalizing
OUTPUT_FILE = "code_review_comments.txt"  # Consider externalizing
REPO_NAME = 'wideGenesis/codereviewer'  # Consider externalizing
MODEL_NAME = "gpt-4o-mini"
REVIEW_ASSISTANT = SYSTEM["code_review_assistant"]
USER_PROMPT = USER["code_review"]

# Logger Setup
logger = CustomLogger(azure_connection_string=None, log_level_local="debug", log_level_azure="debug")

# OpenAI Client Initialization
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
if api_key is None:
    logger.error("OPENAI_API_KEY is not set.")
else:
    completion_client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)

def get_review_params():
    return logger, completion_client, REVIEW_ASSISTANT, USER_PROMPT, MODEL_NAME

def run_local_code_reviewer() -> None:
    """Executes a local code review for the specified repository, branch, and output file."""
    local_code_reviewer(REPO_PATH, BRANCH_NAME, OUTPUT_FILE, *get_review_params())

def run_github_code_reviewer() -> None:
    """Executes GitHub code review for the specified repository."""
    git_hub_code_reviewer(REPO_NAME, *get_review_params())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run_local_code_reviewer()
    run_github_code_reviewer()
```

These changes enhance readability, improve robustness, and provide better maintainability.
